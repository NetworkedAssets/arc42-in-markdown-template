Stakeholders
------------

**Contents.**

Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles
or organizations that

-   should know the architecture

-   have to be convinced of the architecture

-   have to work with the architecture or with code

-   need the documentation of the architecture for their work

-   have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

**Motivation.**

You should know all parties involved in development of the system or
affected by the system. Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in
the development process. These stakeholders determine the extent and the
level of detail of your work and its results.

**Form.**

Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect
to the architecture and its documentation.

| Role/Name   | Contact                   | Expectations              |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Role-1      | Contact-1                 | *&lt;Expectation-1*&gt;   |
| Role-2      | Contact-2                 | *&lt;Expectation-2*&gt;   |
